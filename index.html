Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code was to create a symptom survey that could help diagnose someone with either having allergies or a cold. It includes 6 questions and uses a 
simple math equation to find the percentage of the probability of having allergies or a cold.
 
Known Issues:
I had problems with the buttons at first, which took a while to figure out. Then it was a bit challenging to make the function for the results page. I noticed
that with coding, it is very technical and tedious, so most of the time, my main issues came from very small errors in the code.
